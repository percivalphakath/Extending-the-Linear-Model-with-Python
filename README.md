# Extending-the-Linear-Model-with-Python
<ul> 
<li> Action : Translate the R code into the Python code of the following book</li>
<li> Title of the book : Extending the Linear Model with R: Generalized Linear, Mixed Effects and Nonparametric Regression Models.</li>
<li> Author : Julian J. Faraway </li>
<li> Edition : 2nd </li>
</ul>

## Why?
While studying General Linear Models, I was frustrated that I was learning all this knowledge using R, but most companies prefer Python. The world of Data Science is constantly changing; R is the best language for Statistical Analysis; however, Python is a universal programming language, which is why it is the most preferred language for collaboration. This project aims to help students use this book to understand Python.

## How?
Every month starting from January 2023, I will upload a translated notebook version of each chapter.Therefore, the best way to use these notebooks is to use them in conjunction with the book. Please remember that every time you want to access a dataset specific to this book, you will need to download data from the link provide above to Julian J. Faraway's repo.
