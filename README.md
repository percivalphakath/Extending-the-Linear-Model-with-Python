# Extending-the-Linear-Model-with-Python
In this project, I translate the R code into the Python code of the book by Julian J. Faraway, titled; Extending the Linear Model with R: Generalized Linear, Mixed Effects and Nonparametric Regression Models. Second Edition.

While studying General Linear Models, I was frustrated that I was learning all this knowledge using R, but most companies prefer Python. The world of Data Science is constantly changing; R is the best language for Statistical Analysis; however, Python is a universal language, which is why it is the most preferred language for collaboration. This project aims to help students use this book to understand Python.

Every month starting from January 2023, I will upload a translated version of each chapter.Therefore, the best way to use these notebooks is to use them in conjunction with the book.
