# Extending-the-Linear-Model-with-Python
<ul> 
<li> Action : Translate the R code into the Python code of the following book</li>
<li> Title of the book : Extending the Linear Model with R: Generalized Linear, Mixed Effects and Nonparametric Regression Models.</li>
<li> Author : Julian J. Faraway </li>
<li> Edition : 2nd </li>
</ul>

## Why?
As I immersed myself in learning General Linear Models, I became increasingly vexed by the fact that even though I was gaining a profound comprehension of the subject through R, many companies and organizations seemed to favor Python as their language of choice. Although R still reigns supreme for statistical analysis, the constantly evolving field of Data Science demands adaptability and teamwork, making Python the most popular language. Therefore, my objective with this project is to bridge the gap between Julian J. Faraway's R-focused teachings and students' need to comprehend these concepts using Python.

## How?
Starting from January 2023, I plan to upload a translated notebook version of each chapter of the book on a monthly basis. It is recommended to use the above uploaded notebooks in conjunction with the book itself. However, it is important to note that when working with datasets specific to this book, you will need to download the data from the link provided in Julian J. Faraway's repository or directly from my repository"
