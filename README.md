# Extending-the-Linear-Model-with-Python
<ul> 
<li> Action : Translate the R code into the Python code of the following book</li>
<li> Title of the book : Extending the Linear Model with R: Generalized Linear, Mixed Effects and Nonparametric Regression Models.</li>
<li> Author : Julian J. Faraway </li>
<li> Edition : 2nd </li>
</ul>

## Why?
As I delved into learning about General Linear Models, I found myself feeling frustrated that while I was gaining a deep understanding of the topic through R, many companies and organizations seemed to prefer Python as their language of choice. While R remains the language of choice for statistical analysis, the constantly evolving field of Data Science demands versatility and collaboration, making Python the most widely preferred language. With this project, my aim is to bridge the gap between the R-focused teachings of Julian J. Faraway's book and the need for students to understand these concepts using Python.

## How?
Starting from January 2023, I plan to upload a translated notebook version of each chapter of the book on a monthly basis. It is recommended to use these notebooks in conjunction with the book itself. However, it is important to note that when working with datasets specific to this book, you will need to download the data from the link provided in Julian J. Faraway's repository.
